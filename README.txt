# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Internship Details
- Internship Platform: Uptricks
- Project Type: Machine Learning
- Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Author: Anu

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains credit card transaction details.
Each transaction is labeled as:
- 0 → Non-Fraud
- 1 → Fraud

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Result Analysis

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost  
(mention the one you used)

## Results
The model achieved good accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions and can help reduce financial losses.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries
2. Open Jupyter Notebook
3. Run `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in real-world financial fraud detection.

## Future Enhancements
- Use deep learning models
- Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web application
